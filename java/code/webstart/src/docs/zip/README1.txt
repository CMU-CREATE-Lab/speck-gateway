INTRODUCTION
============

Thank you for downloading the Speck Gateway.  This is the standalone version of the software, intended for use on
computers with no or restricted Internet access. Please be aware that this version will not automatically update itself.
To get the latest version, you will need to re-download it from the Speck Gateway's home page:

   http://specksensor.org

For users having computers with unrestricted Internet access, we encourage the use of the Java Web Start version of the
software, available by clicking the "Launch" button at the above URL.  The Java Web Start version of the software
automatically updates itself to the latest version available.

HOW TO USE
==========

To run the Speck Gateway, simply double-click the speck-applications.jar file in this directory.

If you wish, you can create an alias/shortcut to the speck-applications.jar file and place the alias/shortcut in a
location that's easier for you to access.

For more information about the gateway, different ways of running it, and more advanced options, please see the
README2.txt file.  You can safely ignore the "DOWNLOADING THE GATEWAY APPLICATION" and "BUILDING THE GATEWAY
APPLICATION" sections since, by downloading this zip file, you already have pre-built binaries from which to run the
gateway.
